# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

This is currently a solo project, but I'm open to suggestions, feedback, or small pull requests.

## How to contribute

- Found a bug? Open an issue.
- Got an idea? Open an issue or discussion first.
- Want to fix something? Fork, branch, and send a pull request.

Please keep things simple and clear. One pull request = one change.  
No huge rewrites unless we talk first.

## Code style

- Keep the code clean and readable.
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Be kind â€“ see the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
